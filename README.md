# Astroquest Source Code
Project files for my ICS culminating project "Astroquest".

If you're just interested in playing the game itself, check out the itch.io page here, 
https://dezura.itch.io/ (The itch.io page isn't setup yet so this is temp)

**Note:** If you're going to assess the project, make sure to open the project in Unity editor (2020.2.2f1), as a lot of the scripts won't make sense without the context of the project layout in Unity. 

To add on top of that, remember that this version of the project is still very early and may appear pretty unorganized, but I'll make sure to work on improving the organization as time passes.
