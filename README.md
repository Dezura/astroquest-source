# Astroquest Source Code
Source code for my ICS culminating project Astroquest.

All assets (Other than a few plugins and shaders) are created from scratch and by myself.

If you're just interested in playing the game itself, check out the itch.io page here, 
https://dezura.itch.io/ (The itch.io page isn't setup yet so this is temp)

**Note:** If you're going to assess the project, make sure to open the project in Unity editor (2020.3.4f1), as a lot of the scripts won't make sense without the context of the project layout in Unity. Once you're in unity, go to the Scenes folder under Assets and double click Game World.

Also remember that this version of the project is still very early and may appear pretty unorganized, but I'll make sure to work on improving the organization as time passes.
