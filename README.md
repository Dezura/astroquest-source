# Astroquest Source Code
Source code for my ICS culminating project Astroquest.

All assets (Other than a few plugins and shaders) are created from scratch and by myself.

If you're just interested in playing the game itself, check out the itch.io page here, 
https://dezura.itch.io/astroquest

**Note:** If you're going to assess the project, make sure to open the project in Unity editor (2020.3.4f1), as a lot of the scripts won't make sense without the context of the project layout in Unity. Once you're in Unity, go to the Scenes folder under Assets and double click Game World.
